== Description ==

Gravity Forms PDF Extended is a plugin for Wordpress and Gravity Forms that allows your web server to create PDFs when a user submits a Gravity Form. Not only that, you can then easily attach the document to an email.

== Changelog ==

= 2.2.1 =
* Bug - Fixed HTML error which caused list items to distort on PDF

= 2.2.0 =
* Compatibility - Ensure compatibility with Gravity Forms 1.7. We’ve updated the functions.php code and remove gform_user_notification_attachments and gform_admin_notification_attachments hooks which are now depreciated. Functions gform_pdf_create and gform_add_attachment have been removed and replaced with gfpdfe_create_and_attach_pdf(). See upgrade documentation for details.
* Enhancement - Added deployment code switch so the template redeployment feature can be turned on and off. This release doesn't require redeployment.
* Enhancement - PDF_Generator() variables were getting long and complex so the third variable is now an array which will pass all the optional arguments. The new 1.7 compatible functions.php code includes this method by default. For backwards compatibility the function will still work with the variable structure prior to 2.2.0.
* Bug - Fixed error generated by legacy code in the function PDF_processing() which is located in render_to_pdf.php.
* Bug - Images and stylesheets will now try and be accessed with a local path instead of a URL. It fixes problem where some hosts were preventing read access from a URL. No template changes are required.

= 2.1.1 =
* Bug - Signatures stopped displaying after 2.1.0 update. Fixed issue. 
* Bug - First time install code now won't execute if already have configuration variables in database

= 2.1.0 =

* Feature – Product table can now be accessed directly through custom templates by running GFPDFEntryDetail::product_table($form, $lead);. See documentation for more details.
* Feature – Update screen will ask you if you want to deploy new template files, instead of overriding your modified versions.
* Feature – Product subtotal, shipping and total have been added to $form_data['field'] array to make it easier to work with product details in the custom template.
* Feature – Added two new default template files. One displays field and name in two rows (like you see when viewing an entry in the admin area) and the other removes all styling. See documentation on use.
* Security – Tightened PDF template security so that custom templates couldn’t be automatically generated by just anyone. Now only logged in users with the correct privileges and the user who submitted the form (matched against IP) can auto generate a PDF. See documentation on usage.
* Depreciated – Removed form data that was added directly to the $form_data array instead of $form_data['field'] array. Users upgrading will need to update their custom templates if not using field data from the $form_data[‘field’] array. If using $form_data['field'] in your custom template this won’t affect you.
* Bug – Fixed problem with default template not showing and displaying a timeout error. Removed table tags and replaced with divs that are styled appropriately.
* Bug – The new plugin theme folder will successfully create when upgrading. You won’t have to deactivate and reactivate to get it working.
* Bug – some installs had plugins that included the function mb_string which is also included in DOMPDF. DOMPDF will now check if the function exists before creating it.
* Bug – Remove empty signature field from the default template.
* Bug – fixed problem with redirecting to login screen even when logged in while accessing template file through the browser window directly.
* Bug – fixed error where sample template would reimport itself automatically even after deleting it. Will now only reimport if any important changes to template need to be viewed straight after an update.
* Bug – Moved render_to_pdf.php constants to pdf.php so we can use the constants in the core files. Was previously generating an error.
* Housekeeping – Cleaned up core template files, moved functions into classes and added more in-file documentation.
* Housekeeping – moved install/upgrade code from pdf.php to installation-update-manager.php
* Housekeeping – changed pdf-entry-detail.php class name from GFEntryDetail to GFPDFEntryDetail to remove compatibility problems with Gravity Forms.
* Housekeeping – created pdf-settings.php file to house the settings page code.
